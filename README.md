# 2019-VSCode4Teaching
VSCode extension for teaching.  
Bring the programming exercises of a course directly to the studentâ€™s editor, so that the teacher of that course can check the progress of the students and help them.  
Visit this [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@ivchicano) for updates on the development of this project.
